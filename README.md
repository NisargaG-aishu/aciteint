# Implementation Of Chatbot Using NPL
The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can understand and respond to user input based on intents. The chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) library and Logistic Regression.

---

## Project Overview:
The project is divided into two parts:
NLP techniques and Logistic Regression algorithm is used to train the chatbot on labeled intents and entities.
For building the Chatbot interface, Streamlit web framework is used to build a web-based chatbot interface

----

## Features:

- Natural language understanding using NLTK
- Machine learning-based intent classification
- Conversation history tracking
- Simple and intuitive web interface
- Real-timeÂ responses

---

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- STreamlit
- JSON for intents data

----

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download NLTK Data
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Usage
To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Type your message in the input box and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.

---

## Intents Data
The chatbot's behavior is defined by the `intents.json` file, which contains various tags, patterns, and responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or change existing ones.

---

## Conversation History
The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (`chat_log.csv`). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.
