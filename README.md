# Implementation Of Chatbot Using NPL
The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can understand and respond to user input based on intents. The chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) library and Logistic Regression.

---

## Project Overview:
The project is divided into two parts:
NLP techniques and Logistic Regression algorithm is used to train the chatbot on labeled intents and entities.
For building the Chatbot interface, Streamlit web framework is used to build a web-based chatbot interface

----

## Features:

- Natural language understanding using NLTK
- Machine learning-based intent classification
- Conversation history tracking
- Simple and intuitive web interface
- Real-timeÂ responses

---

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- STreamlit
- JSON for intents data
